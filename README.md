# Homebase

## Description
$project will solve your problem of where to start with documentation,
by providing a basic explanation of how to do it easily.

This Project was created to help me keep better track of my time and therefore become more productive.  

I came up with the idea after I found myself lost in the amount of languages and technologies I wanted to learn.  

The app will display a digital clock athat sits prominently at the center of the screen.  Underneath the clock there is a progress bar
that shows how much time is left in the current hour, like a modern hour-glass.  

It is also capable of detecting your location and displaying weather information for your coordinates.  
The app will display basic information such as current temperature, sunrise, sunset, wind speed, and wind direction. 
The weather data is gathered when the app is initiated and it will update the information every hour.  

Look how easy it is to use:

    import project
    # Get your stuff done
    project.do_stuff()

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
