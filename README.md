# Homebase

## Description
$project will solve your problem of where to start with documentation,
by providing a basic explanation of how to do it easily.

- This Project was created to help me keep better track of my time and therefore become more productive.  

- I came up with the idea after I found myself lost in the amount of languages and technologies I wanted to learn.  

- The app will display a digital clock athat sits prominently at the center of the screen.  Underneath the clock there is a progress bar
that shows how much time is left in the current hour, like a modern hour-glass.  

- It is also capable of detecting your location and displaying weather information for your coordinates.  
- The app will display basic information such as current temperature, sunrise, sunset, wind speed, and wind direction. 
- The weather data is gathered when the app is initiated and it will update the information every hour.  

Look how easy it is to use:

    import project
    # Get your stuff done
    project.do_stuff()
